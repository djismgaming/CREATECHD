# CREATECHD

__Fork to try to remove the timeout preventing the files from being successfully processed by CHDMAN if they are big and take more time than in the timeout.__

__Right now, using `CREATECHD.bat <input directory>` processes all files in that path and saves them as CHD in itself.__ 

## Basic instructions

1. Open your Windows Terminal in the directory containing the clone of this repository or the downloaded files from it
2. Input the command in this way `CREATECHD.bat <input directory>`, changing `<input directory>` with the path to your directory containing the files to be converted/compressed to CHD.
3. Press Enter to process all files in the provided directory. These will be saved in that same directory but in CHD form.
4. Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
